3. List of React Fundamental Concepts Used in the Project
Here are some fundamental React concepts you might have used:

Components: Building reusable components for each part of the website.
JSX (JavaScript XML): Using JSX syntax to structure the component views.
Props: Passing data between components through props.
State Management: Managing component states using useState for dynamic rendering.
Lifecycle Methods: Using useEffect for component lifecycle management.
React Router: For handling client-side routing, allowing for navigation between different pages without refreshing.
Conditional Rendering: Displaying components or elements based on specific conditions.
Event Handling: Handling user interactions like clicks and form submissions.
4. Handling and Managing Data
For data handling, you can choose one or both of the following:

Context API: For managing global state across the application, particularly useful for sharing data across deeply nested components.
Local Storage: Storing user preferences, cart items, or other persistent data in the browser, allowing it to persist even when the page reloads.
(Indicate which one(s) you used and briefly explain how you used them in your project.)
